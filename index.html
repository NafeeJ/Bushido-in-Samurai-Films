      <em>Jidai-geki</em> is a genre of media which rose in popularity during post-war Japan which most commonly takes place in the Edo Period (1603-1868) of Japanese history. These films embody the spirit of the way of the samurai, called "Bushido". Bushido, in the vision of Nitobe Inazō, is characterized by righteousness, heroic courage, benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, loyalty, and self-control.

      Toshiro Mifune plays the role of Sanjuro in the films, <em>Yojimbo</em> and <em>Sanjuro</em> as an extremely skilled, yet eccentric, rōnin. In <em>Yojimbo</em> he wanders into a town, where an old man tells him that there is a conflict between two rival criminal gangs that is repressing the town. However, rather than react how the "ideal" samurai would and immediately respond with a decisive benevolent effort, Sanjuro tells the old man that he is going to try and make a profit. However, by the end of the film, we see that Sanjuro did not actually make a profit, but liberated the town from both gangs. In a subplot of the film, he meets a man who had his wife kidnapped by someone, to which he replied that people like the man made him sick, but he later executed a plan where he was able to save the mans wife from the kidnapper and simultaneously give them money. In <em>Sanjuro</em> he saves a group of "ideal" samurai from being killed, but over the course of the film, he commits acts that are so unseemingly of a samurai that the group he saved doubts him when he says that he is going to "join the other side" and leaves. A couple of these acts are that he asked for money in compensation for saving them and he called an old lady stupid. Despite this, he inevitably proves to them that he is a greater samurai, both by skill, but of a trope within the film that the "ideal" samurai would want to immediately rush in to defeat the enemy which would inevitably fail, while Sanjuro would wait to analyze the situation and make better decisions. Also, at the end of the film, when he defeats an opponent that challenged him, he did not celebrate his victory but acted in respect for his fallen opponent. These events show that despite his outward appearance of not being an ideal samurai that lives by bushidō, he does in fact live by its principles, most notably benevolence, respect, and self-control.

        Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai
      </span>

  <section class="section section-dark">
    <p>
      <em>Ghost Dog</em> tells the story of an assassin in the modern age who read <em>Hagakure</em> and lives by the Way of the Samurai. While this is not a <em>Jidai-geki</em> nor explicitly a samurai film, it shows the embodiment of the spirit of the samurai throughout the film with quotes directly from <em>Hagakure</em> embedded in the film. The main theme from <em>Hagakure</em> expressed in the film is the loyalty and respect. Ghost Dog always makes note as he is talking to his boss that he "doesn't mean to do him no respect". Even at the end of the film when his boss is trying to kill him, he allows him to do so because he knows that he is trying to restore honor to his own boss. There are even scenes throughout the movie where Ghost Dog is depicted acting how a real samurai would. He has a shrine that he bows at, there is a scene where he is practicing with a katana, he draws and "sheathes" his pistol as if it was a katana, and there is a scene of him taking apart and caring for his gun just as how a samurai would maintain his own sword. Every action that he took, he always actively thought about the bushidō code and he lived by it up until his death.
